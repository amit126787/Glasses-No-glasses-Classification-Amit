# Glasses-No-glasses-Classification-Amit
this is a project for school work that classify images of faces with glasses and without glasses
the dataset is in my kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitov/glasses-no-glasses-classification-dataset-amit
and the rest of the files(.py,docs,h5...) are in my github

to run the project open Amit_glasses.py that is the main file.

create a folder named : Glass_No_glasses_project
and insert the dataset folder and saved_history.npy and saved_weights.h5 files to that folder
you can put all the scripts in a new folder named scripts
